Write a Matlab script to compute the bulk modulus, shear modulus, Vp, and Vs of the rocks listed in the table below using their Young's moduli,
A common Compressional wave velocity for saturated, unconsolidated materials is 1400 m/s. If a seismic wave with a frequency of 10 Hz is traveling through this material, what is the wavelength of the wave? What is the wavelength of a wave with a frequency of 100 Hz?
What is the wavelength of a 10-Hz wave propagating through bedrock with a velocity of 4500 m/s? What is the wavelength of a wave with a frequency of 100 Hz?
Calculate the velocity of a compressional wave in a homogeneous rock layer with a density of 2.60 g/cm3, a Young's modulus of 0.39×1011 N/m2, and a Poisson's ratio of 0.11.
Calculate the velocity of a shear wave in a homogeneous rock layer with a density of 2.04 g/cm3, a Young's modulus of 0.07×1011 N/m2, and a Poisson's ratio of 0.14.
Estimate the velocity of Rayleigh waves in a homogeneous rock layer (which is about 90% of S-wave velocity) with a density of 2.52 g/cm3, a Young's modulus of 0.14×1011 N/m2, and a Poisson's ratio of 0.16.
In most common rocks density varies from 2.0 to 3.0 g/cm3, Young's modulus varies from 0.12 to 1.1×1011 N/m2, and Poisson's ratio varies from 0.04 to 0.3. Determine whether density variations or variations in elastic coefficients have the greatest effect on P-wave velocities.
A sandstone has a density of 2.28 g/cm3, a Young's modulus of 0.14×1011 N/m2, and a Poisson's ratio of 0.06. A geophone is located 50 m from a hammer blow. How long will it take the air wave, the direct compressional wave, and the surface (Rayleigh) wave to travel from the hammer blow to the geophone?
An arkose has a density of 2.62 g/cm3, a Young's modulus of 0.16×1011 N/m2, and a Poisson's ratio of 0.29. Twelve geophones are arranged along a line at 10-m intervals. The shot point is located 5 m from the first geophone in the line (and 15 m from the second geophone, etc.). Construct a graph that illustrates time of arrival (vertical axis) against geophone position (horizontal axis) for the air wave, direct P-wave, direct S-wave, and surface wave.
